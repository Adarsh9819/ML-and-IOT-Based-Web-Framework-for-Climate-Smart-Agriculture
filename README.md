ABSTRACT:
With over 70% of rural families in India reliant on agriculture for their livelihoods, its significance to the nation's economy cannot be overstated. Contributing about 17% to GDP, efficient farming practices are essential for sustained growth. However, lacking up-to-date information on soil quality and environmental factors often leads to decreased crop yields. To address these challenges, "Kisaan Dostâ€œ, a web-framework leveraging Machine Learning, IoT, and real-time data analytics, has being develope. This system will collect real-time data on soil quality and environmental parameters, process it for analysis and transmit to cloud and fog computing servers. By harnessing technologies like real-time data analytics and machine learning, valuable insights will be derive to optimize fertilizer application and crop growth. These insights empower informed decision-making, promoting environmentally friendly farming techniques and maximizing crop yields. By facilitating access to agricultural insights, "Kisaan Dost" aims to support optimal crop production and sustainable farming practices across India's agricultural landscape.
